# Hand-Sign-Recognition-using-ESP32-cam
Problem Identified : 
People affected by speech impairment rely only on sign language, which makes it more difficult for them to communicate with the remainder of the majority. 
Deaf and Mute people know how to sign but the vast majority of public do not. 
Solution Proposed :
The solution we propose is making a real time hand sign language detection software which would be helpful for us to learn Sign Language and communicate with them
